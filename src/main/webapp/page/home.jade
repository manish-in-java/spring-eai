      |  This sample application demonstrates integrating an Spring MVC application with
      |  external systems.  This is a common requirement where an existing application
      |  either needs to accept data from or needs to provide data to one or more external
      |  systems.
    p
      |  The table below shows a list of users known to this application.  This list is
      |  populated from a relational database table.  Records can be added to the database
      |  table by making HTTP <code>POST</code> calls to the application at one of the
      |  following REST endpoints provided by the application:
    ul
      li
        code
          /spring/person
      li
        code
          /camel/person
    p
      |  Data can be submitted in either <code>JSON</code> or <code>XML</code> format in the
      |  request body.  For example, a request containing JSON data could look like
    code
      { "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Smith", "emailAdress":"john.smith@example.com" }
    p
      |  Similarly, XML data could look like
    code
      &lt;person&gt;&lt;firstName&gt;John&lt;/firstName&gt;&lt;lastName&gt;Smith&lt;/lastName&gt;&lt;emailAddress&gt;john.smith@example.com&lt;/emailAddress&gt;&lt;/person&gt;
